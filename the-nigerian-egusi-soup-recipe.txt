Ingredients:

 - 600g Egusi (Melon) seeds
 - 2 cooking spoons red palm oil
 - Beef: Best cut and Shaki (cow tripe)
 - Fish: Dry Fish and Stock Fish
 - 3 tablespoons ground crayfish
 - Pepper and Salt (to taste)
 - Vegetable: Nigerian pumpkin leaves, spinach or bitter leaves
 - 3 small stock cubes
 - 1 Ogiri Okpei (traditional locust bean seasoning: optional)

Before you cook Egusi Soup (Caking Method)

1. Before preparing the soup, soak the dry fish for about half an hour. If you are using the very tough stockfish, boil it for 20 minutes and leave in the pot with the hot water to soak for about an hour. If using the softer stockfish, you can just soak them in cool water till you can break them apart with your hands.

2. When the fish and stockfish are soft, debone and break them into sizeable chunks.

3. Much closer to your cooking time, grind the egusi with a dry mill. Grind the crayfish and the dry pepper separately and set aside. Wash the vegetable to be used. Cut into tiny pieces.

4. Boil the shaki, stock fish and dry fish in 1 litre of water with the stock cubes till they are well done. First sign of a done shaki is that the cuts will start curling on itself.

5. Wash the beef to be used for the soup, add it to the pot and cook on medium heat till done.
Cooking Directions: Caking Method

This method produces a healthier egusi soup as there is no frying involved. It requires less oil too.
